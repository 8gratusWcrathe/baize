In this DLC, you will discover that Dr. Wu has been working on his own secret projects, hidden from the Hammond Foundation and the other divisions. He has access to two new locations on Isla Muerta and Isla Tacano, where he has built his hybrid development facility. You will have to work alongside the divisions, while secretly answering to Dr. Wu, and earn his trust to gain access to new dig sites and bring to life five new dinosaurs, three of them being Dr. Wu's hybrids.
 
The new dinosaurs are:
 
- Ankylodocus: A hybrid of Ankylosaurus and Diplodocus, with a long tail club and a herbivorous diet.
- Spinoraptor: A hybrid of Spinosaurus and Velociraptor, with a large sail and a carnivorous appetite.
- Stegoceratops: A hybrid of Stegosaurus and Triceratops, with horns, plates and a beak.
- Olorotitan: A large hadrosaur with a distinctive crest on its head.
- Troodon: A small and intelligent theropod with a venomous bite.

These new dinosaurs will bring new challenges and opportunities for your park management, as well as conflicts of interest and chaos caused by their unpredictable behaviors. You will also unlock powerful new tools for genetic manipulation, allowing you to alter their habitat, social and population requirements, and even make them more compatible with other species. For example, you can make the Indominus Rex camouflage itself and surprise its prey or enemies.
 
Jurassic World Evolution: Secrets of Dr Wu is available for $14.99 on Steam[^1^], and it requires the base game Jurassic World Evolution to play. If you want to experience a new adventure with hybrid dinosaurs and learn more about Dr. Wu's secrets, this DLC is for you!

But is Jurassic World Evolution: Secrets of Dr Wu worth buying? Well, that depends on how much you enjoyed the base game and how eager you are to play with more dinosaurs and genes. The DLC is not very long, as it can be completed in about 5 hours, and it does not add much to the sandbox mode or the challenge mode. However, it does offer some of the most fun and creative missions in the game, as well as some interesting story elements that expand on Dr. Wu's character and motivations. The DLC also adds more variety and possibilities to the genetic system, allowing you to customize your dinosaurs more than ever before.
 
The reviews for Jurassic World Evolution: Secrets of Dr Wu are mostly positive, with an average score of 75/100 on OpenCritic[^1^]. Most critics praised the new dinosaurs, genes and missions, but also pointed out that the DLC is short, expensive and does not address some of the main issues of the base game, such as the lack of depth and replayability. Some critics also noted that the DLC is more challenging and frustrating than the base game, as it requires more micromanagement and careful planning.
 
If you are a fan of Jurassic World Evolution and you want more content and challenge, Jurassic World Evolution: Secrets of Dr Wu might be a good choice for you. However, if you are looking for a major overhaul or improvement of the base game, you might be disappointed by this DLC. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide whether you want to spend $14.99 on this DLC or wait for a sale or a bundle.
